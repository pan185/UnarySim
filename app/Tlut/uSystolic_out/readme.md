Results from running uSystolic-sim simulator on Convnet workload.
- bsys: binary systolic array (MAC cycle=1)
- usys: unary temporal systolic array (MAC cycle=16)

Note: Assuming 0.5 byte per data block, as this will underestimate baseline bandwidth and latnecy and give us conservative performance comparison.
