# Contention Processing

Code taken from https://github.com/diwu1990/uSystolic-Sim/tree/main/simHw

The hardware simulation of *uSystolic-Sim* reports the bandwidth, runtime, and throughput.
For each results, two versions are reported, including:

1. _ideal_ version: perfect results without memory contention.
2. _real_ version: realistic results with memory contention.
